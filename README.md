## TO DO

- Improve `parser.py` `getVocabularySize()` to be more accurate on picking out unique words
- Confirm if `math` module is allowed to import. If not, use `numpy` to get floor
- Refactor `dataVisualization.py`
  - Smarter way on getting `sectionGroups`
  - Can answer and question counters merge into one and use tuple / object?
  - Can the x-axis of post number trend be clearer?
  - Refactor the part where the counters were looped through and data appended into the list
